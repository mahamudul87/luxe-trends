## Store: Luxe Trends

Luxe Trends is a high-end fashion boutique specializing in clothing, accessories, and footwear for both men and women. It offers curated collections from renowned designers and emerging labels, catering to fashion-forward individuals seeking unique and luxurious pieces.

#### SDLC Approach:
The recommended SDLC approach for transitioning Luxe Trends from a brick-and-mortar store to an online-only ECOM store is the Agile methodology. Agile is well-suited for dynamic projects with evolving requirements, such as developing an e-commerce platform. It emphasizes iterative development, allowing for continuous improvement based on feedback from stakeholders and end-users. Additionally, Agile facilitates close collaboration between developers, designers, and business stakeholders, ensuring alignment with business goals and customer needs throughout the development process. (Beck et al., 2001)

#### Application of SDLC Method:

**Requirements Gathering:** Conduct thorough market research to understand customer preferences and online shopping behaviors. Define the features and functionalities of the e-commerce platform, including product catalog, user accounts, shopping cart, checkout process, payment gateway integration, and mobile app compatibility.

**Design:** Create wireframes and mockups to visualize the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the e-commerce website and mobile app. Design a responsive and visually appealing layout that reflects Luxe Trends' brand identity and showcases its products effectively.

**Development:** Implement the e-commerce platform using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development to ensure a seamless and intuitive user interface. For back-end development, leverage a robust and scalable framework such as Ruby on Rails or Django, along with a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL to manage product data, user accounts, and transactions.

**Testing:** Conduct rigorous testing to identify and resolve any bugs or issues in the e-commerce platform. Perform functional testing, usability testing, and security testing to ensure optimal performance, accessibility, and data protection.

**Deployment:** Deploy the e-commerce platform to a reliable hosting provider, ensuring high availability and scalability to accommodate growing traffic and sales volume. Configure SSL encryption to secure communication between users and the server, safeguarding sensitive information such as payment details and personal data.

**Maintenance:** Continuously monitor and maintain the e-commerce platform to address any technical issues, optimize performance, and introduce new features or improvements based on user feedback and market trends.

#### Programming Languages:
-	Vue js(HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for front-end development
-	Django for back-end development
-	PostgreSQL for database management

#### Requirements:

**Secure customer data:** Implement encryption protocols and secure storage mechanisms to protect sensitive information such as credit card details, shipping addresses, and personal preferences.

**Develop a mobile shopping app:** Design and build a mobile application compatible with iOS and Android devices, offering seamless browsing, shopping, and checkout experiences.

**Manage the retailer's database:** Set up a centralized database to store product inventory, customer profiles, order history, and transaction records, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and accessibility for authorized users.

This approach ensures a comprehensive and iterative process for transitioning Luxe Trends into a successful online-only ECOM store, delivering a seamless and secure shopping experience for its customers.
